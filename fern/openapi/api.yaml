      summary: SearchOrders
      description: |-
        Search all orders for one or more locations. Orders include all sales,
        returns, and exchanges regardless of how or when they entered the Square
        ecosystem (such as Point of Sale, Invoices, and Connect APIs).

        `SearchOrders` requests need to specify which locations to search and define a
        [SearchOrdersQuery](entity:SearchOrdersQuery) object that controls
        how to sort or filter the results. Your `SearchOrdersQuery` can:

          Set filter criteria.
          Set the sort order.
          Determine whether to return results as complete `Order` objects or as
        [OrderEntry](entity:OrderEntry) objects.

        Note that details for orders processed with Square Point of Sale while in
        offline mode might not be transmitted to Square for up to 72 hours. Offline
        orders have a `created_at` value that reflects the time the order was created,
        not the time it was subsequently transmitted to Square.

        Creating new locations allows for separate configuration of receipt layouts, item prices,

        that integrate with Square from sales activity elsewhere in a seller's account.
        Locations created programmatically with the Locations API last forever and
        are visible to the seller for their own management. Therefore, ensure that

            \ count for the sold number of the variation, the stocked \nnumber of the\
            \ variation, or both. For example, when a variation representing wine is stocked\

            \ But when a variation of the wine is sold by the glass, the sold units cannot\

            \ is sellable, but not stockable. To accurately keep track of the wine's inventory\
            \ count at any time, the sellable count must be \nconverted to stockable count.\
            \ Typically, the seller defines this unit conversion. For example, 1 bottle\
            \ equals 5 glasses. The Square API exposes \nthe `stockable_conversion` property\
            \ on the variation to specify the conversion. Thus, when two glasses of the\
            \ wine are sold, the sellable count \ndecreases by 2, and the stockable count\
            \ automatically decreases by 0.4 bottle according to the conversion."

        Filter for `Order` objects based on whether their `CREATED_AT`,

        You can specify the time range and which timestamp to filter for. You can filter
        for only one time range at a time.

        For each time range, the start time and end time are inclusive. If the end time
        is absent, it defaults to the time of the first request for the cursor.

        __Important:__ If you use the `DateTimeFilter` in a `SearchOrders` query,
        you must set the `sort_field` in [OrdersSort](entity:SearchOrdersSort)
        to the same field you filter for. For example, if you set the `CLOSED_AT` field
        in `DateTimeFilter`, you must set the `sort_field` in `SearchOrdersSort` to
        `CLOSED_AT`. Otherwise, `SearchOrders` throws an error.

            this item, the restaurant records the purchase by creating an `Order` object with a line item
            for a burger. The line item includes a line item modifier: the name is cheese and the quantity
            is 1. The buyer has the option to order extra cheese (or no cheese). If the buyer chooses
            the extra cheese option, the modifier quantity increases to 2. If the buyer does not want
            any cheese, the modifier quantity is set to 0.

        When you take a payment through Square's Payments API (using the `CreatePayment`
        endpoint), Square evaluates it and assigns a risk level to the payment. Sellers
        can use this information to determine the course of action (for example,

            object defined by the application making the request.
            
            If the `CatalogCustomAttributeDefinition` object is
            defined by another application, the `CatalogCustomAttributeDefinition`'s key attribute value is prefixed by
            the defining application ID. For example, if the `CatalogCustomAttributeDefinition` has a `key` attribute of
            `"cocoa_brand"` and the defining application ID is `"abcd1234"`, the key in the map is `"abcd1234:cocoa_brand"`

            Otherwise, the key used in the map is simply `"cocoa_brand"`.
            
            Application-defined custom attributes are set at a global (location-independent) level.
            Custom attribute values are intended to store additional information about a catalog object
            or associations with an entity in another system. Do not use custom attributes

        The wrapper object for the catalog entries of a given object type.
        
        Depending on the `type` attribute value, a `CatalogObject` instance assumes a type-specific data to yield the corresponding type of catalog object.
        
        For example, if `type=ITEM`, the `CatalogObject` instance must have the ITEM-specific data set on the `item_data` attribute. The resulting `CatalogObject` instance is also a `CatalogItem` instance.
        
        In general, if `type=<OBJECT_TYPE>`, the `CatalogObject` instance must have the `<OBJECT_TYPE>`-specific data set on the `<object_type>_data` attribute. The resulting `CatalogObject` instance is also a `Catalog<ObjectType>` instance.

            When a Gift Card is a payment source, you can allow taking a partial payment
            by adding the `accept_partial_authorization` parameter in the request.
            However, taking such a partial payment does not work if your request also includes
            `tip_money`, `app_fee_money`, or both. Square declines such payments and returns
            the `GIFT_CARD_AVAILABLE_AMOUNT` error.
