      summary: SearchOrders
      description: |-
        Search all orders for one or more locations. Orders include all sales,
        returns, and exchanges regardless of how or when they entered the Square
        ecosystem (such as Point of Sale, Invoices, and Connect APIs).

        `SearchOrders` requests need to specify which locations to search and define a
        [SearchOrdersQuery](entity:SearchOrdersQuery) object that controls
        how to sort or filter the results. Your `SearchOrdersQuery` can:

          Set filter criteria.
          Set the sort order.
          Determine whether to return results as complete `Order` objects or as
        [OrderEntry](entity:OrderEntry) objects.

        Note that details for orders processed with Square Point of Sale while in
        offline mode might not be transmitted to Square for up to 72 hours. Offline
        orders have a `created_at` value that reflects the time the order was created,
        not the time it was subsequently transmitted to Square.

        Filter for `Order` objects based on whether their `CREATED_AT`,
        `CLOSED_AT`, or `UPDATED_AT` timestamps fall within a specified time range.
        You can specify the time range and which timestamp to filter for. You can filter
        for only one time range at a time.

        For each time range, the start time and end time are inclusive. If the end time
        is absent, it defaults to the time of the first request for the cursor.

        __Important:__ If you use the `DateTimeFilter` in a `SearchOrders` query,
        you must set the `sort_field` in [OrdersSort](entity:SearchOrdersSort)
        to the same field you filter for. For example, if you set the `CLOSED_AT` field
        in `DateTimeFilter`, you must set the `sort_field` in `SearchOrdersSort` to
        `CLOSED_AT`. Otherwise, `SearchOrders` throws an error.

            for a burger. The line item includes a line item modifier: the name is cheese and the quantity
            is 1. The buyer has the option to order extra cheese (or no cheese). If the buyer chooses
            the extra cheese option, the modifier quantity increases to 2. If the buyer does not want
            any cheese, the modifier quantity is set to 0.

            Keys written by applications must be 60 characters or less and must be in the character set

            Your application should monitor responses for `429 RATE_LIMITED` errors and use a retry mechanism with an [exponential backoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff)
            schedule to resend the requests at an increasingly slower rate. It is also a good practice to use a randomized delay (jitter) in your retry schedule.
